    <p>My research is dedicated to advancing the large-scale application of smart building information systems, particularly at the intersection of artificial intelligence and building HVAC systems. By systematically integrating innovations at the <strong>data</strong>, <strong>platform</strong>, and <strong>application</strong> layers, I explore how to leverage time-series data mining, machine learning, and visualization techniques to address core issues such as building energy efficiency, thermal dynamic modeling.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>data layer</strong>, I developed a portable data collection system to reduce the complexity of deploying AI models, designed a long-term data stream generation model to provide high-fidelity data support across seasons, and proposed a real-time data augmentation model to dynamically optimize thermal dynamic models.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>platform layer</strong>, I built an intelligent HVAC platform that integrates model development, testing, and user interaction. By introducing ML models including large model technology, I enhanced the stability and generalization of prediction models and developed a contrastive curriculum training method tailored for the HVAC domain. Additionally, I established the benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate different models' performance and created LLM-assisted visualization tools to help non-technical personnel quickly generate test code.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>application layer</strong>, my research has been applied in real-world scenarios: automatically modeling highly reliable thermal dynamic models for individual rooms to reduce expertise and experimental studies involved, significantly improving modeling efficiency. I also utilized data generation techniques to assess the potential of buildings in demand response, laying the foundation for large-scale intelligent control.</p>
    <p>These efforts form a complete loop from theory to application, providing key technological support for smart building initiatives.</p>

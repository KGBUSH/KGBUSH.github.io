I am a final-year PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (香港理工大学), supervised by [Prof. Dan WANG](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/).
My research interest lies in the areas of the evaluation and deployment of machine learning models for cyber-physical energy systems. Some special topics such as data acquisition, data augmentation, and large model for smart building are highly involved.


Prior to PolyU, I gained valuable industry experienceworked as machine learing engineer at Huawei Shanghai Institute and JD.com, two China's leading tech companies. This year-long stint provided me with practical insights into the application of AI in real-world scenarios.
I received the M.S. in Computer Science from Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Chenxi Zhang and Prof. Jiangfeng Li, and the B.S. in Computer Science from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

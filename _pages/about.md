<!-- My research interest lies in the areas of the evaluation and deployment of machine learning models for cyber-physical energy systems. Some special topics such as data acquisition, data augmentation, and large model for smart building are highly involved.-->
<!-- Previously, I received the M.S. in Computer Science from Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Chenxi Zhang and Prof. Jiangfeng Li, and the B.S. in Computer Science from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. -->














I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), working with [Prof. Dan WANG](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csdwang/), who also supervised my PhD.
Prior to PolyU, I gained valuable industry experience worked as machine learing engineer at Huawei Shanghai Institute and JD.com, two China's leading tech companies. This three-year experience provided me with practical insights into the deployment of AI in real-world scenarios, which inspired my pursuit of a PhD.


During my PhD study in PolyU, my research interest lies in machine learning model evaluation in Building Energy System, with hands-on experience in time series forecasting and applications in building HVAC system. 
I have also contributed my expertise to support AI competitions for Building E&M Facilities hosted by the Hong Kong government.
My recent research centers on enhancing the "generalizability" of AI in (building) energy systems, with a focus on two key areas: 1) large foundation models and 2) ML model fusion.
